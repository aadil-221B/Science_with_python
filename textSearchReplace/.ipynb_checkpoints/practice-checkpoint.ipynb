zero and\\n', '\\n', '59\\n', '04:34.590 --> 04:40.770\\n', 'then proceeding to compute the determinant of this equation and altogether that gives us the characteristic\\n', '\\n', '60\\n', '04:40.830

with Lambda and Lambda squared.\\n', '\\n', '64\\n', '04:59.250 --> 05:05.490\\n', \"Now once you collect all of these like terms you'll end up with an expression that looks like this.\\n\", '\\n', '65\\n', '05:05.520 --> 05:15.240\\n', 'So it should be minus lambda cubed plus 10 times lambda squared plus eleven lambda equals zero Now something\\n', '\\n', '66\\n', '05:15.270 --> 05:22.030\\n', 'interesting has happened here all of these terms have a lambda attached to them which means that we\\n', '\\n', '67\\n', '05:22.030 --> 05:29.950\\n', 'can take a lambda out of each of these terms and rewrite this expression as minus lambda times.\\n', '\\n', '68\\n', '05:29.980 --> 05:36.160\\n', 'All of this stuff and immediately that tells us that lambda equals zero is a solution.\\n', '\\n', '69\\n', '05:36.160 --> 05:43.030\\n', \"So when you set this lambda to be zero it doesn't actually matter what's inside this parenthetical statement\\n\", '\\n', '70\\n', '05:43.360 --> 05:47.390\\n', \"that's immediately going to set to make this equation true.\\n\", '\\n', '71\\n', '05:47.440 --> 05:55.300\\n', \"That means that one of the eigenvalues of this matrix is zero and I'm going to have an entire video\\n\", '\\n', '72\\n', '05:55.330 --> 05:59.140\\n', 'just about this phenomenon a little bit later in this section.\\n', '\\n', '73\\n', '05:59.140 --> 06:03.550\\n', 'But essentially when an eigenvector is an eigenvalue is zero.\\n', '\\n', '74\\n', '06:03.730 --> 06:10.360\\n', 'It means that the matrix is singular and that you can actually see by looking at this matrix and you\\n', '\\n', '75\\n', '06:10.360 --> 06:19.080\\n', 'see that column 1 plus column 2 equals column 3 so whenever you have a singular matrix at least one\\n', '\\n', '76\\n', '06:19.140 --> 06:22.110\\n', 'eigenvalues value is going to be equal to zero.\\n', '\\n', '77\\n', '06:22.170 --> 06:30.450\\n', 'And in fact the number of eigenvalues that are equal to zero tells you about the rank of this matrix.\\n', '\\n', '78\\n', '06:30.490 --> 06:33.870\\n', 'More on that in the later video.\\n', '\\n', '79\\n', '06:33.880 --> 06:39.160\\n', \"Now once you've gotten to this step you can further factor this equation and you end up with the result\\n\", '\\n', '80\\n', '06:39.160 --> 06:44.360\\n', 'that lambda equals zero lambda equals minus 1 and Lambda equals eleven.\\n', '\\n', '81\\n', '06:44.590 --> 06:50.110\\n', 'So you can probably guess that this is going to be the tricky I can value to compute the corresponding\\n', '\\n', '82\\n', '06:50.110 --> 06:55.600\\n', 'I can vector of and this is the one that I got a little bit stuck with.\\n', '\\n', '83\\n', '06:55.600 --> 06:57.490\\n', 'And so I used Matlab as a crutch.\\n', '\\n', '84\\n', '06:57.490 --> 06:58.540\\n', 'I cheated a little bit.\\n', '\\n', '85\\n', '06:59.250 --> 07:01.500\\n', \"OK so but let's go through all of these.\\n\", '\\n', '86\\n', '07:01.840 --> 07:07.840\\n', 'So we start with zero and now this is kind of a funny thing because we are shifting the matrix by zero\\n', '\\n', '87\\n', '07:08.200 --> 07:10.970\\n', \"which actually means we're not changing the matrix at all.\\n\", '\\n', '88\\n', '07:11.140 --> 07:21.000\\n', 'And that means that this matrix A already has a non-trivial null space even without doing any shifting.\\n', '\\n', '89\\n', '07:21.130 --> 07:28.010\\n', 'So this problem actually boils down to finding a vector in the null space or a basis for the null space.\\n', '\\n', '90\\n', '07:28.270 --> 07:35.380\\n', 'Even without doing any shifting so based on what I just told you about how do I set up this matrix that\\n', '\\n', '91\\n', '07:35.660 --> 07:42.950\\n', 'column one plus column two equals column three a basis for the null space is 1 one minus 1.\\n', '\\n', '92\\n', '07:42.970 --> 07:49.130\\n', 'So you can try for each of these rows the first column plus the second column minus the third column\\n', '\\n', '93\\n', '07:49.220 --> 07:52.090\\n', 'equals zero all right.\\n', '\\n', '94\\n', '07:52.100 --> 07:53.270\\n', \"So now let's move on.\\n\", '\\n', '95\\n', '07:53.270 --> 07:59.350\\n', 'So now we shift this matrix by eleven and this is basically where I got stuck and switch to matlab.\\n', '\\n', '96\\n', '07:59.360 --> 08:04.570\\n', 'So it turns out that eigenvector is nineteen forty one and thirty six.\\n', '\\n', '97\\n', '08:04.580 --> 08:10.430\\n', 'So if you figured out this I can vector on your own without using a computer then good for you you are\\n', '\\n', '98\\n', '08:10.460 --> 08:14.960\\n', 'a better or at least more patient mathematician than I am.\\n', '\\n', '99\\n', '08:15.200 --> 08:19.210\\n', 'And then we get to the third eigenvalue which was minus one.\\n', '\\n', '100\\n', '08:19.220 --> 08:21.130\\n', 'So now that becomes plus one.\\n', '\\n', '101\\n', '08:21.230 --> 08:26.390\\n', 'And here is that shifted matrix and this one you should be able to solve on your own.\\n', '\\n', '102\\n', '08:26.480 --> 08:28.810\\n', \"In fact it's even easier than it looks.\\n\", '\\n', '103\\n', '08:28.820 --> 08:35.930\\n', 'And if you need a hint before I show the answer then the hint is just consider that this third column\\n', '\\n', '104\\n', '08:36.020 --> 08:42.340\\n', 'is actually pretty useless if you get rid of this third column it becomes really easy to find the \\n', '\\n', '105\\n', '08:42.380 --> 08:46.520\\n', 'eigenvector in this shifted matrices null space.\\n', '\\n', '106\\n', '08:46.790 --> 08:52.400\\n', \"So in fact it's one minus one and then zero you just set the third element to be zero.\\n\", '\\n', '107\\n', '08:52.670 --> 08:59.810\\n', 'So that leads us to the big picture overview of the eigendecomposition of this three by three singular\\n', '\\n', '108\\n', '08:59.810 --> 09:06.130\\n', 'matrix rank 2 matrix we have eigenvalues 0 minus 11 and minus 1.\\n', '\\n', '109\\n', '09:06.200 --> 09:09.200\\n', 'And these are the corresponding eigenvectors.\\n', '\\n', '110\\n', '09:09.200 --> 09:12.430\\n', \"And notice I've written them as row vectors and then transpose.\\n\", '\\n', '111\\n', '09:12.430 -->
