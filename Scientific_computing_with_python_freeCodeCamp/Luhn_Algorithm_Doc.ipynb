    "# Implementing the Luhn Algorithm Project\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Purpose üõ†Ô∏è\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Luhn Algorithm is a checksum formula used for error-checking in various applications, including verifying credit card numbers, validating identification numbers, and detecting errors in numeric data. By implementing this project, you'll gain valuable experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation while understanding a fundamental method for data validation and integrity verification.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Algorithm Overview üìù\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The Luhn Algorithm works by performing a series of steps on a numeric string to compute a checksum digit. The algorithm is as follows:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. Starting from the rightmost digit (least significant digit), double every second digit.\r\n",
    "2. If the doubled digit is greater than 9, subtract 9 from it.\r\n",
    "3. Sum up all the digits, including the doubled digits.\r\n",
    "4. If the total sum is a multiple of 10, the numeric string is considered valid according to the Luhn Algorithm.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Implementation Steps üî¢\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "To implement the Luhn Algorithm project, you'll need to follow these steps:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Input Validation:** Ensure that the input is a valid numeric string.\r\n",
    "2. **Reverse the String:** Reverse the input string to simplify digit manipulation.\r\n",
    "3. **Compute the Doubled Digits:** Double every second digit from the right (or from the left, depending on the reversed string).\r\n",
    "4. **Sum the Digits:** Add up all the digits, including the doubled ones.\r\n",
    "5. **Check Validity:** If the total sum is divisible by 10, the numeric string is valid according to the Luhn Algorithm.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Project Benefits üöÄ\r\n",

    "# Luhn Algorithm for Credit Card Number Verification\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Code Overview\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The given Python code implements the Luhn Algorithm to verify the validity of a credit card number.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### `verify_card_number(card_number)`\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This function takes a credit card number as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the card number is valid according to the Luhn Algorithm.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Input:** `card_number` (string) - The credit card number to be verified.\r\n",
    "- **Output:** `True` if the card number is valid, `False` otherwise.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### `main()`\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This function serves as the entry point of the program. It generates a sample credit card number, removes any spaces or hyphens from it, and then calls the `verify_card_number()` function to check its validity. Finally, it prints whether the card number is valid or invalid.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Code Explanation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 1. Input Processing\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The input credit card number is processed to remove any spaces or hyphens using the `str.maketrans()` and `translate()` methods. This ensures that the credit card number consists only of digits.\r\n",
    "- The processed credit card number is stored in the `translated_card_number` variable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 2. Luhn Algorithm Verification\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The Luhn Algorithm verification is performed in the `verify_card_number()` function.\r\n",
    "- The function first calculates the sum of the digits at odd positions (counting from the right) in the reversed card number.\r\n",
    "- Then, it calculates the sum of the digits at even positions (doubled and adjusted if necessary) in the reversed card number.\r\n",
    "- The total sum of both odd and even digits is computed.\r\n",
    "- If the total sum modulo 10 is equal to 0, the card number is considered valid according to the Luhn Algorithm.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "### 3. Output\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- The result of the Luhn Algorithm verification is printed in the `main()` function.\r\n",
    "- If the card number is valid, 'VALID!' is printed. Otherwise, 'INVALID!' is printed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Conclusion\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The provided Python code demonstrates a practical implementation of the Luhn Algorithm for verifying credit card numbers. It showcases string manipulation techniques, numerical computations, and conditional logic to determine the validity of a given credit card number.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "---\r\n",
